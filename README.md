# GAD
I chose to produce a fractal tree that grows organically over time. The slider has been included to add user input, this changes the angle of the branch to mimic a tree's growth. the stroke weight of the tree decreases as the branches increase. this adds a more realistic aesthetic to the tree. 
If I could improve on the project, I would add a button to reset and automate the slider to increase as the branch angle increases.
